# Readme

## App setup

Initialized with create-react-app.

No libraries except for node-sass

## Code base

This app was made using functional components and hooks (useState, and a custom hook)
Styling is made using scss (mostly because like nesting, nothing we would not have achieved with plain css)

The layout is mostly Flex based and offers two versions, one for desktop, one for mobile displays.

We use the custom hook in App to fetch all required data and feed it to child components through props.

The design uses Mansa colors from the getMansa.com website.

Edit: I just added TypeScript support to the app, and added some Type definition
